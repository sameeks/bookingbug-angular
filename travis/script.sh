# The -e flag causes the script to exit as soon as one command returns a non-zero exit code. This can be handy if you want whatever script you have to exit early. It also helps in complex installation scripts where one failed command wouldnâ€™t otherwise cause the installation to fail.
# The -v flag makes the shell print all lines in the script before executing them, which helps identify which steps failed.
